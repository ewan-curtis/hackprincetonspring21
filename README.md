# roomExport
#### A Google Chrome extension, built for HackPrinceton Spring 2021, that allows the user to easily download room data from [rooms.tigerapps.org](http://rooms.tigerapps.org). Instead of manually copying information about various rooms to a spreadsheet, roomExport does it for you. Just filter the room data as you wish and click the extension icon, and your data will automatically download as a .csv file.
